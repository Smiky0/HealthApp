# HealthAppNS - AI Health Prediction and Personal Medical Record

**HealthAppNS** is a health-tracking application designed to empower users to monitor and assess potential health risks with the help of machine learning. The app collects essential health metrics, stores personal medical information, and leverages AI to analyze the probability of certain diseases, all accessible through a secure, easy-to-use web interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI Health Risk Assessment**: Users can input personal health data (e.g., blood pressure, height, weight) to receive insights from a machine learning model on potential health risks.
- **Personal Medical Record Storage**: Securely stores user medical history and key health metrics, allowing users to track changes over time.
- **Google Authentication**: User-friendly login via Google, implemented with Firebase Authentication.
- **Personalized Dashboard**: New users are prompted to provide basic health information to personalize their experience.
